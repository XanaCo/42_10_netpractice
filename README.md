## Overview

The "Net_Practice" project is an interactive simulation designed to immerse students into the intricate world of network configuration and the nuances of the TCP/IP protocol. Spanning across 10 distinct levels, this endeavor provides students with progressively challenging scenarios where they must troubleshoot and configure virtual networks to meet specific criteria. The entire project is presented via a web browser interface, combining theoretical knowledge with practical application in an engaging manner.

## Key Components

1. **Web-based Interface**: The project revolves around an interactive browser interface, accessed by running the provided `index.html` file. This interface presents students with network diagrams, configuration options, and feedback mechanisms.

2. **10 Progressive Levels**: Students face 10 different network scenarios, each with its unique challenges and configuration problems.

3. **Real-time Feedback**: The interface incorporates real-time validation tools, such as the "Check again" button, allowing students to verify their solutions on-the-fly.

4. **Configuration Export**: Upon solving each level, students can use the "Get my config" button to download and save their successful network configurations, which are essential for project submission.

5. **Login and Correction Modes**: The interface provides two distinct modes. One allows practice runs using student logins, while the other offers a "correction" mode for the actual evaluations.

6. **Journal of Log**: An integral part of the interface, this feature aids students by providing real-time feedback on their configurations, highlighting issues, and suggesting areas of improvement.

## Key Skills Developed

1. **TCP/IP Understanding**: This project deepens students' grasp of the TCP/IP protocol, especially the intricacies of addressing and routing.

2. **Practical Network Configuration**: Students get hands-on experience in configuring virtual networks, closely mimicking real-world scenarios.

3. **Troubleshooting**: Armed with feedback from the interface, students hone their troubleshooting skills, identifying and rectifying network issues.

4. **Interactive Learning**: Engaging with the browser-based interface fosters a blend of theoretical knowledge and practical application.

5. **Attention to Detail**: With each level presenting unique challenges, students must display meticulous attention to detail to ensure all network parameters align perfectly.

6. **Time Management**: Given the progressive difficulty of the levels and the time constraints during evaluations, effective time management becomes crucial.

7. **Export and Documentation**: The ability to export configurations for submission ensures students are adept at documenting and presenting their solutions clearly.
